Eg 1-> Pizaa 
Base pizza -> decorate 
->extra cheese
->mushroom
->extra cheese
->vegies
->chicken slice

Eg 2->
Coffee->decorate with Cream+ decorate with chocochips+extra sugar

Eg 3-> base car->power steering+ac+fog lamp

Why we need decorator pattern
-> to avoid class explosion<br />
for eg if create base class(pizza) and we create all variant child class
but what about extra topping and customised order we won't be able to create all this scenario
and If are able to create all this , it will create a lot of class.
